					0x00. Pascal's Triangle
Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of n:

Returns an empty list if n <= 0
You can assume n will be always an integer

Pascal triangle is an exciting concept of mathematics where a triangular array is formed by summing adjacent elements in the preceding row. In simple words, every number is generated by taking up the sum of the adjacent row, and the outside edges of a triangle are always 1. It is named after the famous French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Below is the representation of the Pascal triangle.

			Algorithm to Print Pascal's Triangle in Python
Step - 1: Taking input from the user to get the number of rows.

Step - 2: Declare an empty list that will store the values.

Step - 3: Using for loop, which will iterate through 0 to n - 1, append the sub-lists to the list.

Step - 4: Now append 1 to the list.

Step - 5: Now, use for loop to define the value of the number inside the triangle adjacent row.

Step - 6: Print Pascal triangle according to the format.
